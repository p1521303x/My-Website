what did not go well
1. Trying to place the social media icons in the footer was tricky, everytime the size of the website changed the social media icon was all over the place.

2. Coding on javascript was difficult as I had errors with my sentax therefore by visitig the development console and checking what the error was and where it was had resolved the issue.

3. After adding breakpoint (media query) to make my website to be responsive for users to use the website on mobile, tablets and desktop coding to resize the images containg inside the box was tricky and everything resized and the images didnt.
The issues was not resolved hoewever the websites is still responsive for users use.

4. making the slides for javascript was not a proble, however when it came to being responsive I was unable to find what codes was needed to change its size so it can be responsive for mobile use.
Was unable to resolve the issue and is left to default size for large screens.
